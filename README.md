# DeepLearning.ai Courses Notes
Deep Learning Specialization on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)

My Path to Learning DL. This repository contains my personal notes on DeepLearning.ai specialization courses, 18 October 2020

## About this Specialization
In five courses, you will learn the foundations of Deep Learning, understand how to build neural networks, and learn how to lead successful machine learning projects. You will learn about Convolutional networks, RNNs, LSTM, Adam, Dropout, BatchNorm, Xavier/He initialization, and more. You will work on case studies from healthcare, autonomous driving, sign language reading, music generation, and natural language processing. You will master not only the theory, but also see how it is applied in industry. You will practice all these ideas in Python and in TensorFlow.
