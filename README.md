# Deep Learning Specialization | [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)
Path to learning DL | Day-1: 18 October 2020

## About this Specialization
You will learn about Convolutional networks, RNNs, LSTM, Adam, Dropout, BatchNorm, Xavier/He initialization, and more. You will work on case studies from healthcare, autonomous driving, sign language reading, music generation, and natural language processing. You will master not only the theory, but also see how it is applied in industry. You will practice all these ideas in Python and in TensorFlow.
