### What is neural network? 
- [Lecture notes](01_What_is_Neural_Network.pdf)

### Supervised Learning for Neural Networks
- [Lecture notes](02_Supervised_Learning_for_Neural_Network.pdf)
- Supervised - regression and classification problems. Regression problem - predict results within a continuous output, trying to map input variables to some continuous function. Classification problem, we are instead trying to predict results in a discrete output, we are trying to map input variables into discrete categories.  
- Application of supervised learning <br><img src="media/supervised-learning.png" width=300>
- Types of neural networks: **Convolution Neural Network (CNN)** used often for image application and **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** used for one-dimensional sequence data such as translating English to Chinses. As for the autonomous driving, it is a hybrid neural network architecture.

### Why is Deep Learning taking off?
- [Lecture notes](03_Why_is_Deep_Learning_Taking_Off.pdf) 
- Large amount of data! We see that traditional algorithms reach to a threshold on performance. However, NN always works better with more data. So you can get better performance as long as you collecting more and more data, without changing the algorithm itself.

### Binary Classification
- [Lecture notes](04_Binary_Classification.pdf) 
- Here are some notations:
  - `M is the number of training vectors`
  - `Nx is the size of the input vector`
  - `Ny is the size of the output vector`
  - `X(1) is the first input vector`
  - `Y(1) is the first output vector`
  - `X = [x(1) x(2).. x(M)]`
  - `Y = (y(1) y(2).. y(M))`
### Logistic Regression
- [Lecture notes](05_Logistic_Regression.pdf), [YouTube Video Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_xBe7MbPwk) & [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFfsSgQgerw)
- Predict whether `0 or 1`, classification algorithm of 2 classes
- `y` to be in between `0 and 1` (probability): `y = sigmoid(w^T*x + b)`

### Logistic Regression Cost Function
- [Lecture notes](), [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MztgenIfGgM)
- The cost function measures the accuracy of our hypothesis function. Quantifies the error between predicted values and expected values. 
- Now we are able to concretely measure the accuracy of our predictor function (hypothesis) against the correct results we have so that we can predict new results we don't have.
- First loss function would be the square root error:` L(y',y) = 1/2 (y' - y)^2`
  - But we won't use this notation because it leads us to optimization problem which is non convex, means it contains local optimum points.
- This is the function that we will use: `L(y',y) = - (y*log(y') + (1-y)*log(1-y'))`
- To explain the last function lets see:
  - if `y = 1` ==> `L(y',1) = -log(y')` ==> we want y' to be the largest ==> y' biggest value is 1
  - if `y = 0` ==> `L(y',0) = -log(1-y')` ==> we want 1-y' to be the largest ==> y' to be smaller as possible because it can only has 1 value.
- Then the Cost function will be: `J(w,b) = (1/m) * Sum(L(y'[i],y[i]))`
- The loss function computes the error for a single training example; the cost function is the average of the loss functions of the entire training set.

### Gradient Descent
- *Gradient Descent* - so we have our hypothesis function and we have a way of measuring how well it fits into the data. Now we need to estimate the parameters in the hypothesis function. That's where gradient descent comes in.
- [YouTube video: What is the Gradient Descent?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzrQvzYEvYc)
- Gradient Descent basically just does what we were doing by hand â€” change the theta values, or parameters, bit by bit, until we hopefully arrived at a minimum. I am comparing it with a cost function right now. 
- We want to predict `w` and `b` that minimize the cost function.
- First we initialize `w` and `b` to 0, 0 or initialize them to a random value in the convex function and then try to improve the values the reach minimum value.
- The derivative give us the direction to improve our parameters.
- The actual equations we will implement:
  - `w = w - alpha * d(J(w,b) / dw)` (how much the function slopes in the w direction)
  - `b = b - alpha * d(J(w,b) / db)` (how much the function slopes in the d direction)

### Derivatives
- Derivative of a linear line is its slope.
  - ex. `f(a) = 3a` `d(f(a))/d(a) = 3`
  - if `a = 2` then `f(a) = 6`
  - if we move a a little bit `a = 2.001` then `f(a) = 6.003` means that we multiplied the derivative (Slope) to the moved area and added it to the last result.
- To conclude, Derivative is the slope, and this slope is different in different points in the function thats why the derivative is a function.

### Derivatives with a Computation Graph
- Calculus chain rule says: If `x -> y -> z` (x effect y and y effects z) Then `d(z)/d(x) = d(z)/d(y) * d(y)/d(x)`
- Back prop for computing the derivatives
