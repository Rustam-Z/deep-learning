- Here are some classical CNN networks:
    - **LeNet-5**
    - **AlexNet**
    - **VGG**

- **ResNet** with 152 layers

- **Inception** architecture by Google is a good example to apply

##  WEEK 3: Object detection 
> Learn how to apply your knowledge of CNNs to one of the toughest but hottest field of computer vision: Object detection.

> Learning Objectives:
> - Describe the challenges of Object Localization, Object Detection and Landmark Finding
> - Implement non-max suppression to increase accuracy
> - Implement intersection over union
> - Label a dataset for an object detection application
> - Identify the components used for object detection (landmark, anchor, bounding box, grid, ...) and their purpose

### Object Localization
- Classification with localization problem (one object). Detection is finding multiply objects.

- <img src="img/45.PNG" width=500>

- We will output `pc=1` if there is an object, the placement (`bx, by, bh, bw`), and the object in the picture (`1. 0, 0`)

- If `pc=0` then other numbers are *don't-cares*

- The lost function:
    ```
    L(y',y) = {
                (y1'-y1)^2 + (y2'-y2)^2 + ...           if y1 = 1
                (y1'-y1)^2						        if y1 = 0
            }
    ```
- <img src="img/46.PNG" width=500><img src="img/47.PNG" width=500>

### Landmark Detection
- Outputting some points from the piture is the **landmark detection**

- `lx, ly` corners of eye, mouth, nose or finding the edge of the face

- <img src="img/48.PNG" width=500>

### Object Detection
- Cut up the picture and detect the object, we will use 'Sliding windows algorithm'.

- **Sliding windows detection** - choose a region, stride and detect, then make a bigger region. For each region feed the Conv net and decide if it's a car or not.

- SWD is very slow, high computational cost.

- https://github.com/mbadry1/DeepLearning.ai-Summary/tree/master/4-%20Convolutional%20Neural%20Networks#object-detection-1

### Convolutional Implementation of Sliding Windows
- We can turn Fully Connected layers into Convolutional layers

- <img src="img/49.PNG" width=500>

- Convolution implementation of sliding windows: <br><img src="img/50.PNG" width=500>

- <img src="img/51.PNG" width=500>

- The weakness of the algorithm is that the position of the rectangle wont be so accurate. Maybe none of the rectangles is exactly on the object you want to recognize. <br><img src="img/53.png" width=500>

### Bounding Box Predictions
- YOLO - You Only Look Once, developed in 2015

- Take a picture, divide into grid cells, implement classification with localization for each grid cell

- <img src="img/52.png" width=500><img src="img/54.png" width=500>

- https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2018/12/practical-guide-object-detection-yolo-framewor-python/

- How to Label images for YOLO https://cloudxlab.com/blog/label-custom-images-for-yolo/

### Intersection Over Union
- Intersection Over Union is a function used to evaluate the object detection algorithm.

- The higher the IOU the better is the accuracy. Usually `>0.5` or `>0.6`

- <img src="img/55.PNG" width=500>

### Non-max Suppression
- Non-max suppression helps to choose the best bounding box for the particular object.

- <img src="img/57.PNG" width=500><img src="img/56.PNG" width=500>

### Anchor Boxes
- For detecting multiple objects in one grid. You must define the number of boxes by hand.

- https://github.com/mbadry1/DeepLearning.ai-Summary/tree/master/4-%20Convolutional%20Neural%20Networks#anchor-boxes

### YOLO Algorithm
- https://towardsdatascience.com/object-detection-part1-4dbe5147ad0a

- https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/26403/how-does-yolo-algorithm-detect-objects-if-the-grid-size-is-way-smaller-than-the

- Receptive field in CNNs: https://medium.com/mlreview/a-guide-to-receptive-field-arithmetic-for-convolutional-neural-networks-e0f514068807

- The algorithm runs a convolutional network on the entire image at the same time, and the way you've drawn it the network will output a tensor of shape 3x3xk where k is the number of features that it needs to represent the selected number of bounding boxes. Each one of these output neurons has a receptive field much larger than the box itself, meaning that the output neurons in the lower center can see the entire woman and the entire car. The output neurons in the lower right can see most or all of the car too, but it sees that the center of the car isn't in it's box so it knows it doesn't have to spit out a bounding box.

- <img src="img/58.PNG" width=500><img src="img/59.PNG" width=500><img src="img/60.PNG" width=500>

### Quiz on Detection algorithms
5. When training one of the object detection systems described in lecture, you need a training set that contains many pictures of the object(s) you wish to detect. However, bounding boxes do not need to be provided in the training set, since the algorithm can learn to detect the objects by itself.
    > False

7. .In the YOLO algorithm, at training time, only one cell â€”the one containing the center/midpoint of an objectâ€” is responsible for detecting this object.(**Note:** Even thought the object might be detected in more than one bounding box the `winner` will always be the one with its midpoint since all the other boxes would lead to a smaller IoU and be cut out in the process)
    > True

## WEEK 4: Face Recognition

### Face Recognition
- Face recognition (identifies face) and liveness detection (supervised learning)

- Face verification vs. face recognition:
    - Verification:
        - Input: image, name/ID. (1 : 1)
        - Output: whether the input image is that of the claimed person.
        - "is this the claimed person?"
    - Recognition:
        - Has a database of K persons
        - Get an input image
        - Output ID if the image is any of the K persons (or not recognized)
        - "who is this person?"

- We can use a face verification system to make a face recognition system.

### One Shot Learning
<img src="img/61.png" width=500><img src="img/62.png" width=500>

### Siamese Network
- The function of `d` is to input two faces and tell how similar or how different they are. A good way to do this is to use a **Siamese network**.

- <img src="img/63.png" width=500><img src="img/64.png" width=500>

- Use back propagation to tune the parameters

-  But how do you actually define an objective function to make a neural network learn to do what we just discussed here? (triplet loss function)

### Triplet Loss
